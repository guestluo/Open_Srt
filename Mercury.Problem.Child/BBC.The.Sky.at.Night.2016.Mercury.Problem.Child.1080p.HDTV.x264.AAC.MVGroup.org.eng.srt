1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,760
This week, our skies will see a rare
daytime astronomical event.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,600
On Monday, if the weather's
better than this,

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,240
we'll be able to watch
a transit of Mercury

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,040
when the solar system's smallest
planet passes in front of the sun.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,520
Centuries of work allow us
to predict precisely

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,960
when this event will occur.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,080
But although we know exactly
where Mercury is,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,880
it's a planet that we know
surprisingly little about.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,080
I like to think of it as the solar
system's problem child

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,800
cos it so often
confounds our expectations.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,520
A planet this close to the
sun should be baked dry

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,880
and yet there's ice on its surface.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,120
It is expect such a tiny world to have
solidified into

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,680
an inactive ball of rock...

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,240
..but Mercury is geologically alive.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,720
It even appears to be shrinking.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,960
On this month's programme,

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,560
we'll be investigating Mercury's
curious behaviour.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,480
And Pete Lawrence will be here
to explain how you can watch

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,760
the transit in safety.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,280
So, tonight, in all its glory,
we give you Mercury -

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,080
the most puzzling
planet in the solar system.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Welcome to The Sky At Night.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,120
At first glance, the thing that
strikes you about Mercury

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,520
is that it looks a lot
like our moon -

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,560
a bare, pale rock
covered in craters.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
It's even a similar size.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,720
But in reality,
Mercury is not at all like the moon.

29
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,880
In fact, it's not like anywhere
else in the solar system.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,440
Mercury has long been
seen as an enigmatic planet,

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
but it's difficult to observe
because it's orbit is so close to
the sun.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,720
So, whenever we look at it,
it's lost in the sun's glare.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,600
Even so, with observations
from Earth,

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,480
we can map out Mercury's
unusual orbit.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,280
Unsurprisingly, Mercury,
being the closest planet to the sun,

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
has the shortest orbit.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,720
It takes just 88 days to go
all the way round.

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
It also has the most elliptical
orbit

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,840
of all the planets in the solar
system.

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,120
At its closest approach,
it's just 46 million kilometres

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,960
away from the sun, and, at
its furthest, 70 million kilometres.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Now, that's unusual,
but things get really weird

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
when you take into account
Mercury's rotation.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
Mercury rotates very slowly.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,320
It actually takes 59 Earth days for
it to complete one revolution.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
But as it rotates, Mercury is also
moving around its orbit.

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,880
And the combination of
rotation and orbit

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,360
causes the sun to move
very slowly across the sky.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,560
So slowly in fact that
from the planet's surface, a day

50
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,440
from sunrise to sunrise
actually lasts two complete orbits.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,320
So, on Mercury,
a day is twice as long as its year.

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,920
That means that, on the surface,
daylight lasts the equivalent of

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,960
three Earth months and temperatures
rise to around 450 Celsius.

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,440
That's followed by three months
of night-time,

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
where the temperatures plummet
to minus 180.

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
This temperature
difference of over 600 degrees

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,680
is the highest experienced
anywhere in the solar system.

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,160
That made it all the more surprising
when astronomers at the Arecibo

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,040
radio telescope bounced radar
pulses off the planet.

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,840
The signals that came back showed
bright spots near the poles

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,840
that bore the unmistakable
signature of water ice.

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,520
The shape of the ice deposits
clearly showed that they were

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,360
concealed in the depths of polar
craters -

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,600
the only areas on the planet that
never receive any direct sunlight.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
That means that, on this planet,

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
three times closer to the sun
than Earth,

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,680
you can still find water ice.

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
That's pretty amazing.

69
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,800
But there's only so much
we can tell by observing from Earth.

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,560
To learn more about Mercury,
we need spacecraft data.

71
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,000
Only two missions have ever
visited the planet -

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,240
the first was Mariner 10 in 1974.

73
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,560
Its camera only produced
grainy pictures,

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,640
but the other instruments it
carried began to reveal major

75
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,280
differences between Mercury
and the other rocky planets.

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,080
I've come to the Open University
in Milton Keynes to talk to

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Mercury expert David Rothery.

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,600
When they see images of Mercury,
like this one,

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,680
you can't fail to be intrigued by
it.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
It's got a wonderful landscape.

81
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,080
It's a beautiful image as well,
but we've only sent two spacecraft

82
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,560
two Mercury, compared to many that
have been to Venus and Mars.

83
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
Why is that? Why is Mercury being
neglected?

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
Well, Mars and Venus
are the low-hanging fruit -

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,160
they are closer to the Earth.

86
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,680
And at first sight,
certainly they are more interesting.

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,440
Mercury, when we first sent
a probe by it, it's airless,

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,880
it's heavily cratered,
it's a little bit dull.

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,320
Now we realise it is not
dull at all.

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
There's all kinds of things
going on there.

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,920
Even that first mission,
the Mariner mission,

92
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,000
that flew past made some remarkable
discoveries. It did.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
It was equipped with a magnetometer

94
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,200
to look at the interaction
between the solar wind,

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,840
the charged particles from the Sun
and the planet's surface,

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,640
but it found that the planet's
generating its own magnetic field.

97
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,480
It's like a scaled-down version
of the Earth's magnetic field.

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,800
And that's surprising, for
such a small planet

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
to have a magnetic field.

100
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
It's really, really unusual.
Absolutely.

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,560
Mars, the Moon and Venus don't
generate a magnetic field,

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,880
but Mercury does.

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,960
And, you know, it caught
everybody by surprise.

104
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
And thank goodness Mariner 10
carried its magnetometer.

105
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
But what does it tell us?

106
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,400
What do we need to be able to
generate this magnetic field?

107
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,920
OK, well, some people say,
"Well, iron in the core.

108
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,520
"You've got a core made of iron -
it will be a magnet."

109
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,560
But that doesn't work.
It has to be fluid.

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,760
You have to have an electrically
conducting fluid churning around,

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,880
so we think the outer
part of Mercury's interior core

112
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,760
is made of molten iron, and that's
the explanation that holds for the
Earth as well.

113
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,600
Well, that would make sense,
apart from the fact that Mercury's
such a small world.

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,440
On Mars, for example, we think
that there's no magnetic field

115
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,200
because it's cooled down and
there's no longer any fluid core.

116
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,960
Yeah, well, Mercury should be
cooling down as well

117
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,800
cos it's got a large surface
compared to its volume.

118
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,520
It was probably quite hot to begin
with, but there is also clearly some

119
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
way of generating heat in the core
to stop it having frozen,

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
and also something to
reduce the melting

121
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
temperature of the outer
part of the core -

122
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,000
we think that is probably sulphur.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,080
Mixed in with the iron?
Mixed in with the iron.

124
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,880
There has to be enough iron to make
an electrical conductor.

125
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,120
So what we think is happening is
iron is still today sinking

126
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,080
inwards to join the frozen inner
core of solid iron

127
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,040
and, as the iron sinks inwards,

128
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,960
it's turning gravitational energy
into heat

129
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,080
and that's heating the outer
part of the core, which is gradually

130
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,080
becoming richer in sulphur,
reducing its melting temperature

131
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,920
and enabling it to churn round
and generate a magnetic field.

132
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,280
So we know about one process that is
happening inside Mercury -

133
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,920
what do we know about the rest
of its structure?

134
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,800
We do know that the
core must be very,

135
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,200
very large compared to the
size of the planet. Wow!

136
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,080
Beyond the iron-rich inner core
and outer core, you've got the rock.

137
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
Most of the rock is what we
call the mantle,

138
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,080
there's a crust on the outside that
is slightly chemically different.

139
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,120
This rocky outer part is much,

140
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,040
much thinner on Mercury than it is
on any of the other rocky planets.

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,400
It's the opposite of the earth,
where we have quite a thick mantle
and a thin core.

142
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
So, to me, this is one of the great
mysteries of Mercury.

143
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,920
Why do we have this large core
surrounded by a thin mantle?

144
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Absolutely.

145
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,240
Mariner had started to reveal
Mercury's inner secrets,

146
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,640
but we had to wait another 35 years
for a really good

147
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,440
look at Mercury's surface.

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,080
That finally came in 2011,
when NASA's MESSENGER probe

149
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,480
started returning high-definition
images like these.

150
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,000
The team here in Milton Keynes
are using these images to create

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,200
detailed geological maps of Mercury,

152
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,640
but they're also finding plenty more
evidence of Mercury's strangeness.

153
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,240
So, Jack, if we can interrupt,
what are you working on?

154
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm making a geological map
of a region on Mercury, this area

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,680
you see here. I'm using data
from NASA's MESSENGER satellite,

156
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,840
planetary images mosaiced together,

157
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,680
and I'm interpreting the geological
units I see at the surface.

158
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,200
And so what I see when
I look at this globe of Mercury is

159
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,400
craters and I think that's what
people think of.

160
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,440
Like the moon, it's a
grey body with a cratered surface.

161
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
You're absolutely right.

162
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
It is a heavily cratered
surface in places.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
However, there is more to Mercury.

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,040
For example, these lobate scarps
that you see here,

165
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,640
this one is called Carnegie Rupes.

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,840
So that's this line
running from top left to bottom,

167
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,920
right across the image. Absolutely.

168
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,120
This is an escarpment
in the landscape caused by faulting

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,800
within the crust of Mercury.

170
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,880
So we see this
kind of thing on Earth,

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,800
these places where you have this
sort of raised up area.

172
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes, you see these things on Earth.

173
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,240
On Earth we have plate tectonics

174
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
and, because of the collisions
of plates, we find them building

175
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,840
mountains and making escarpments
in the landscape such as this one.

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,280
However, there's no evidence to
suggest Mercury has multiple

177
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,240
tectonics plates that move around
and collide with each other,

178
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,520
so instead this is internal
deformation within one plate

179
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,240
that's being drawn in from within.

180
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,120
So it's almost as
if the whole planet is shrinking.

181
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,680
Yes, the planet
is in a state of global contraction.

182
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,200
And people have looked
at the distribution of these lobate

183
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,560
scarps over the planet
and added up all their effects,

184
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,840
and they calculate that perhaps
the planet has

185
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,040
lost as much as 7km of its planetary
radius. That's enormous.

186
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,400
That's Everest-ish... It's hard to
imagine a planet shrinking,

187
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,680
but Mercury
demonstrates that it has.

188
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,200
So what's causing this?
Why is there this shrinking?

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,960
As the planet loses heat,
this causes a volume reduction,

190
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,720
particularly because as the liquid
part of Mercury's iron core freezes,

191
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,680
that causes a volume reduction,
which pulls the crust in everywhere.

192
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,560
So it's quite a simple process
but, Dave,

193
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,840
this isn't the only thing that's
happening on the surface.

194
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,720
If we look elsewhere, we can find
evidence of other processes.

195
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,120
Far from it. There's all kinds of
things that have gone on on Mercury.

196
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,960
One thing that comes to mind is
something that we didn't know about

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,440
until MESSENGER got there, which is
these areas called hollows.

198
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,720
There's a view here
that's about 20-30km across

199
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,760
and it's showing an area of surface
where the top 20m of material

200
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,680
is just gone, it's been stripped
away to leave that irregular area.

201
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,400
There's some smaller hollows nearby.

202
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,640
It looks a bit like mould or Swiss
cheese, or something like that.

203
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,440
Absolutely. How is it being removed?

204
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,120
It's not falling into caverns,

205
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,000
it's not being blowing away in the
wind, there's no wind.

206
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,480
It's turning to vapour somehow
and just being lost to space,

207
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,720
so something in the surface
is volatile.

208
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,440
Volatile enough to turn to vapour
and just go.

209
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,120
So what could that be? It's a big
problem and we can't tell from this.

210
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,080
It could be sulphur,
could be chlorine.

211
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,640
Is it driven by heat or charged
particles breaking chemical bonds?

212
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,640
But there is evidence of volatile
richness in the planet,

213
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,520
which was completely unexpected.

214
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,880
Something this close to the sun
ought not to be rich in volatiles.

215
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
Why not?

216
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,840
Close to the sun you should be
losing volatiles as you're

217
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,240
trying to grow a planet because it's
hot and, because Mercury has

218
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,120
a large core, people thought it's
had a violent birth.

219
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,760
How do you get such a large core
and a thin, rocky area?

220
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,240
You blast the rock away,

221
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,320
but that should be stripping away
the volatiles as well,

222
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
and yet Mercury has retained it's
volatiles

223
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,280
and still got a large core.

224
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,360
It doesn't fit. And it's a world
that's changing now.

225
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,680
Some of these processes are still
happening.

226
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,720
The hollow-forming
processes are still going on today.

227
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,640
When you look at fields of hollows,
you don't find impact craters

228
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,880
superimposed. We think the hollows
are still growing in some areas.

229
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,360
Who would have thought
Mercury would be an active planet?

230
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
That adds up to Mercury being a very
exciting place. Thank you very much.

231
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,920
Pleasure.

232
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,360
One of the reasons that we knew
so little about Mercury for

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,000
so long was that it's difficult to
observe from the Earth.

234
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,880
But this week's transit will give
everyone the chance to see

235
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,240
this mysterious planet...

236
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,160
..and Peter's here to explain the
best way to view the transit safely.

237
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,720
As planets go,
Mercury isn't far away.

238
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,280
Only 48 million
miles at closest approach.

239
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,200
But it's surprisingly hard
to observe...

240
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,240
because being so close to the sun,

241
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,760
it is only ever visible for a short
period,

242
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,960
just before sunrise or after sunset.

243
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,120
But this week's transit is a great
opportunity to see

244
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,080
the planet during broad daylight.

245
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,600
We won't get another
chance as good as this until 2049.

246
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,200
Eclipse glasses are a great way to
look at the sun safely,

247
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,120
but unfortunately Mercury is going
to be too small to be seen

248
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
with the naked eye.

249
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,960
It's about 1/155th the apparent
size of the sun,

250
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,880
so to see it at all you're going to
need something

251
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
with a bit more power -

252
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,320
say a telescope or a powerful
pair of binoculars.

253
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,400
But to be safe, these must be fitted

254
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,720
with a certified solar safety
filter.

255
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,280
There are various filters available,
but one of the easiest ways

256
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,920
to achieve this is to get hold of
an A4 sheet of solar safety film

257
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,120
and then make your own filter,

258
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,080
which slips on the front
of the telescope - just like that.

259
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,480
You can point
the telescope at the sun...

260
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,080
..and you're good to go.

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,520
With the filter in place,

262
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,240
you should get a view of the whole
of the sun's disk,

263
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,040
on which it's possible to make
out small sun spots.

264
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,520
This one is about the size that
Mercury will

265
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,360
appear during the transit.

266
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,320
The transit will begin just after
noon, with the sun high in the sky.

267
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,600
You will see Mercury make first
contact with the eastern

268
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,760
edge of the sun
and will then track southwest

269
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,880
until the transit
finishes at 7:42 in the evening.

270
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,280
If you don't have a filter
then there is another way to get

271
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,040
a decent view of the sun
and that's to project it.

272
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,520
Now, projection is only really
suitable for small refracting

273
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,560
or lens-based telescopes.
But using a small refractor,

274
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,120
if you point this
directly at the sun with

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,840
an eyepiece in the eyepiece holder,
it's then possible to project

276
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,880
an image of the sun onto
a piece of white card

277
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,440
and it actually gives you
a really good view.

278
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
One final warning,
if you're using this method,

279
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,800
is to not keep the telescope pointed
at the sun for too long a period.

280
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,560
If you do, you run
a risk of damaging the internal

281
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,080
components of the telescope.

282
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,560
If it's got plastic bits inside,
for example, they may melt

283
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,080
and plastic eyepieces may melt,
as well.

284
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,440
Also, be careful

285
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,200
because the temperature just
behind the eyepiece is really hot.

286
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,680
I can demonstrate that with this
little piece of black card.

287
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,560
Look at that.
That didn't take very long at all.

288
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,520
Makes Bear Grylls look pretty
pathetic, doesn't it?

289
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,760
HE LAUGHS

290
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,720
Hopefully, on the day of the
transit,

291
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,480
the skies will be lovely
and clear like they are today.

292
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,400
But if the clouds do come,

293
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,200
in the event is so long at 7.5 hours
from beginning to end that we do

294
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,520
stand at least a decent possibility
of some clear breaks

295
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,480
where we'll see something of it.

296
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,880
The end of the transit occurs with
the sun just

297
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,280
nine degrees above the northwest
horizon,

298
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,160
so if you do intend to watch
the entire event then make sure

299
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,960
you've got a clear view in that
particular direction.

300
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,080
So clear skies and good luck.

301
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,040
If you don't have the right
equipment,

302
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,720
there will be lots of events
happening all over the country,

303
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,840
like here at the Open University,
where you can watch the transit

304
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,880
in the company of your local
astronomers.

305
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,400
And if it does happen
to be cloudy, like today,

306
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,520
then Isa are streaming the transit
live from space using

307
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,120
satellites that will get a great
view whatever the weather,

308
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
and we'll have
details of that stream

309
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,480
and the list of events
on our website.

310
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,280
But transits are more than just rare
and remarkable events -

311
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,680
they also have significant
scientific value.

312
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,840
We asked public astronomer
Marek Kukula

313
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,720
from the Royal Observatory
Greenwich to investigate.

314
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
To understand the importance
of transits,

315
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,520
we need to geo
back to the 17th century,

316
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,480
to the time just after the founding
of the Royal Observatory.

317
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,440
This is what was known as the solar
system in the second

318
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,880
half of the 1600s. The six inner
planets all orbiting around the sun.

319
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
The outer planets, of course,
hadn't been discovered yet.

320
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,400
It was a model we'd had since
the time of Copernicus and Kepler.

321
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,320
We knew the order of the planets and
we knew the shape of their orbits,

322
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,480
but there was one thing about the
solar system we didn't know -

323
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,120
we didn't know how big it was.

324
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,400
Although the relative
sizes of the orbits were understood,

325
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,760
for instance, we knew that the
Earth was three times

326
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
further from the sun than Mercury,

327
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,960
the actual distances weren't known.

328
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,040
It was a solar system without scale.

329
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,560
And that's where this guy comes in.
He's Edmund Halley.

330
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,360
He'd later become Astronomer Royal
himself, but in 1677 he was

331
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,240
just an assistant astronomer, here
at the observatory in Greenwich.

332
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,360
And he'd been sent to St Helena
in the South Atlantic to observe

333
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,600
the southern skies.

334
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,440
While he was there,
he watched a transitive Mercury,

335
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,000
just like the one that's
due this week.

336
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,160
Watching Mercury crawl across the
face of the sun,

337
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,360
Halley realised how a transit could
be used to measure

338
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
the size of the solar system.

339
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,120
Halley's breakthrough
was to understand that

340
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,960
if you viewed the transit from two
widely spaced locations,

341
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,800
thousands of miles apart, then
you'll see the transit differently.

342
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,200
Viewed from here,
south of the equator,

343
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
the planet will appear
here against the disk of the sun.

344
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,520
But viewed from north of the
equator,

345
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,560
the planet will appear
further down on the sun's disk.

346
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,320
What Halley realised was that

347
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,280
if you could measure the apparent
separation between the points,

348
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,400
the parallax, then you could work
out

349
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,760
the distance between the earth and
the sun.

350
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
It was a calculation that required

351
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,480
some fiendishly complicated
geometry.

352
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,160
But to produce an accurate figure,
it also needed a number

353
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,840
of extremely precise measurements to
be made during the transit...

354
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,760
..including, most crucially,

355
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,720
the exact time it takes
for the planet to cross the sun.

356
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,600
But here Halley faced a problem.

357
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,720
Mercury was so small and travelled
so fast that it would be almost

358
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,400
impossible to make
the measurements required.

359
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,400
A more suitable target was Venus,

360
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,840
which appears both bigger
and slower as it transits the sun.

361
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,920
But the next transit of Venus
wasn't due for another 84 years.

362
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,160
Halley knew he'd be long dead by
then,

363
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,120
so he laid down the gauntlet
for future generations.

364
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,160
Almost a century later, the world's
astronomers rose to that challenge.

365
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,760
There were transits of Venus in 1761
and 1769,

366
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,640
and expeditions were sent out all
around the world to observe them.

367
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,480
These expeditions were
among the first great international

368
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,200
scientific collaborations

369
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,280
and, in many ways, they were like
the Large Hadron Collider

370
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,680
or International Space Station of
their day.

371
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
The French, British
and Austrians went to Siberia

372
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,080
and Northern Canada,

373
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,080
where they had to brave polar bears
and hostile locals.

374
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,680
They went to the Indian
and Pacific Oceans.

375
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,360
Captain James Cook was sent
to Tahiti in 1769.

376
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,680
And these were major expeditions
for the time,

377
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,040
involving perilous sea voyages
sometimes lasting several years.

378
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,320
There was one French expedition to
Mexico from which only one

379
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,800
person returned alive.

380
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,160
And to make matters worse, during
some of this time,

381
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
France and Britain were at war

382
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,800
and special arrangements had to be
made to give safe passage

383
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
to scientists from each side.

384
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,760
Once they'd arrived,
each team had to spend weeks

385
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,400
calculating their latitude
and longitude.

386
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,560
And this is dated from Cook's
voyage in 1769.

387
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,080
You can see how detailed it is.

388
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,040
They're even using the moons of
Jupiter to calculate their
longitude.

389
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,640
And once they'd done that,
they had to hope for clear

390
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
skies for the transit itself.

391
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,800
The crucial measurement was to time
how long it took Venus to

392
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,720
cross the disk of the sun to within
a couple of seconds.

393
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,840
And these are drawings by Captain
Cook himself and they perfectly

394
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,360
illustrate a really crucial
problem that they discovered.

395
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,080
It's an optical illusion -
the so-called "black drop effect".

396
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,080
And as Venus starts to cross
the disk of the sun,

397
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,200
the disk of Venus appears to stretch
out and blur,

398
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,840
and that makes it very difficult
to measure

399
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,480
the precise
time at which the transit begins.

400
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,640
The black drop effect made it
impossible to record

401
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,560
the length of the transit with
the desired accuracy...

402
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,000
..but the data they did collect was
enough for astronomers

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,480
to start their calculations.

404
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,520
In 1771, the French astronomer
Jerome Lalande calculated

405
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,960
a value for the astronomical unit,

406
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,240
the distance between the earth
and the sun, of 153 million km,

407
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,960
which is impressively
within 2.5% of the modern value.

408
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,200
Suddenly, the solar system had a
scale.

409
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,800
That's why transits were
important historically.

410
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,720
But today, transits are still
important in helping us

411
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
understand our position
in the universe

412
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,160
because of the role they play
in showing how many other planets

413
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,200
there are outside the solar system.

414
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,000
Whenever a planet passes in front
of the sun,

415
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
it blocks out a small
but measurable amount of its light.

416
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,360
The same principle applies
when we look at other stars -

417
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,920
it's very difficult to observe
their planets directly -

418
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
but we can see the tiny drop in
brightness

419
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,080
as the planet passes in front of the
star.

420
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,960
It's exactly this technique that the
Kepler space telescope uses.

421
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,640
It monitors 100,000 stars, looking
for the telltale dip in luminance

422
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,720
that indicates a transiting planet.

423
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,640
By using this method, it has in
the last seven years detected

424
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,280
nearly 6,000 possible exoplanets.

425
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,720
When you're watching a transit,
like the one this week,

426
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
you should bear in mind a couple of
things.

427
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,240
One is that what you are watching is
a clear example

428
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,920
of the solar system in action -

429
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,000
planets actually moving
along their orbits in real time.

430
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,360
But also what you're seeing isn't
just a pleasing spectacle

431
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,200
because transits, perhaps more
than any other phenomenon,

432
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,000
have helped us to understand
the scale and scope of our universe.

433
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,400
Mercury is undoubtedly
a strange world.

434
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,240
With its large iron core
and its thin mantle,

435
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,120
it's not like any of the rest of the
family of rocky planets.

436
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,440
So what happened in Mercury's
formation to make it this way?

437
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,360
Maggie has been talking to planetary
scientist Craig Agnor to

438
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,000
discuss the latest ideas.

439
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,560
Craig, can you describe to me

440
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,000
the old theory of the formation of
Mercury?

441
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,160
One of the initial ideas was that
Mercury's mantle was removed

442
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,720
through a giant impact.

443
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,600
And the initial modelling of this
suggested a smaller object,

444
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,160
maybe a third the mass of Mercury,
smashed in at very high velocity,

445
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,680
vaporised the mantle,
blasted off into space

446
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,840
and this would have predicted a very
hot but iron-rich planet.

447
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,400
OK, so an iron-rich planet,
so a large core and a thin mantle,

448
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,680
so that does tie in with what
we see of Mercury.

449
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
That's exactly right.

450
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,240
The problem is that recent
spacecraft data has shown

451
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,720
that Mercury's mantle retains
a significant

452
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
inventory of volatiles that wouldn't
have survived the extreme

453
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,120
heating of this initial scenario.

454
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,880
They would have been blown
off into space with the temperature.

455
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,680
That's right. OK, so there's
a challenge there. That's right.

456
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,520
So you have to look at the different
types of giant impacts that

457
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,160
occur during planet formation.

458
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,880
One of the new ideas about this
origin of Mercury is that

459
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,680
maybe Mercury hit a larger
object at slower velocity

460
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,200
and this collision may be able to
remove the mantle without

461
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,240
the extreme heating
of the earlier scenario.

462
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,600
OK, so we keep the volatiles.

463
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,680
Wonderful.

464
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,920
So what we see in this animation
here is kind of a proto-Mercury

465
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,720
and a proto-Venus on crossing
orbits that will eventually

466
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,600
result in a giant impact.

467
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,760
So the impact was actually
between Venus and Mercury. Right.

468
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,880
So what actually
happens during impact?

469
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,800
The way we study this is through
computer simulations.

470
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,760
You can model a planet in this

471
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,400
simulation from Arizona State by
Erik Asphaug and Andreas Reufer.

472
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,600
An iron core shown in blue, rocky
mantles are shown in red or orange.

473
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,520
This type of collision is called
a hit and run collision,

474
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
where the two objects
slam into each other,

475
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,440
they sheer off a portion of their
mantles

476
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,640
and they leave the scene of the
crime.

477
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,440
The impact happens at a modest
velocity,

478
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,800
so this is quite a bit more gentle
than the smaller,

479
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,160
high velocity impact collisions.

480
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,120
OK. So this could explain the core,
the mantle,

481
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,960
but the volatiles as well.

482
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,840
That's right. So, in this scenario,
what happens to Venus?

483
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,360
Part of the proto-Mercury's mantle
may have been deposited onto Venus

484
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,560
and that may help to explain why
Venus has a little more

485
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,120
mantle material relative to the
size of its core than the Earth.

486
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,000
So this theory is looking
pretty good now

487
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,560
because we've got this collision,

488
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,360
we've got Mercury left with a large
iron core and a thin mantle,

489
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,120
we've got Venus with an extra
mantle,

490
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
which is what we actually see in
reality,

491
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,560
so it does seem to stand up.
So what happens next?

492
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,280
It's not the end of the story

493
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,600
because its orbit continues
to evolve

494
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,840
and, over the next five billion
years,

495
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,800
there's about a 1% chance that its
orbit can become so eccentric

496
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,440
that it again crosses the orbit of
Venus.

497
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,000
It can suffer giant impacts with
Venus or Earth,

498
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,360
or it may collide with the sun.

499
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,200
Gosh. 1% probability is quite high,
really,

500
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,840
that our solar system could change
radically. That's right.

501
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,080
So it's not as static as
I take for granted.

502
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,320
No, the solar system is an amazingly
dynamic place. Thanks very much.

503
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Thank you.

504
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,080
We still don't understand
everything about Mercury

505
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,120
or how it became
the planet it is today.

506
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,760
It remains the problem
child of the solar system.

507
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,760
But by studying Mercury's
peculiarities

508
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,360
and troubled beginnings, we are
producing new insights into

509
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,440
the processes that formed and shaped
the whole of the inner solar system.

510
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,680
When we started working on this,
I thought Mercury was the least

511
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,920
interesting of planets,

512
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,560
but the more you find out about it
the more fascinating it is.

513
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,160
I was particularly interested
in the fact that the formation

514
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,240
of Mercury tells us more about the
dynamics of the early solar system.

515
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,440
Well, that's all we've got
time for this month.

516
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,240
But if you're going to watch
the transit tomorrow, good luck.

517
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,760
If you're watching us on repeat,
I hope it was clear.

518
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
That's it for this month,

519
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,280
but do check out the website,
where we've got Pete's star guide.

520
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,360
And in the meantime,
get outside and get looking up...

521
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,480
but never directly at the sun.
Goodnight.
